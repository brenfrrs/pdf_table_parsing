Determining the number of herbivores a land base can
sustain presents a persistent challenge particularly in multi-
species grazing systems [1-5]. This sustained stocking rate is
commonly termed carrying capacity [6,7] and is used as a
metric to balance ecological, economic, and aesthetic con-
cerns [8-11]. In practice, carrying capacity is rarely meas-
ured [12] and initial estimates are progressively adjusted in
adaptive management programs. In addition, the term “‘carry-
ing capacity” is used in numerous ways, adding to the com-
plexity of the problem [6,13].

Solutions are constrained first by plant removal rates and
safe-use factors (SUF) where forage removal by native ungu-
lates is commonly set between 35-50% of annual growth to
allow for variation in forage availability [18-20]. The forage
reserve (i.e., the proportion of the forage remaining) may be
used to provide a buffer against stochastic environmental
conditions and prevent degradation of vegetation during
years with unfavorable growing conditions [21]. In strongly
seasonal environments, another hedge provided by the forage
reserve is sufficient opportunity for diet selection to meet
seasonal quality thresholds. Although range scientists and
managers frequently use various vegetative measures of
range condition to ensure long-term sustainability [22,23],
criteria for evaluating appropriate stocking levels seldom
include measures related to the animals present in the system
[24.25].

Abstract: Elk Island National Park in western Canada provides an ideal case study for an economic carrying capacity es-
timate because it supports high density of four species of ungulates (1 1/km/), lacks large predators, and is enclosed by a
2.1-meter mesh fence. This high density of ungulates has created persistent management challenges by altering vegetation
structure and community composition. Using linear programming, we explored optimal allocation of forage resources for
bison (Bison bison bison), moose (Alces andersoni), wapiti (Cervus elaphus manitobensis) and deer (Odocoileus virgini-
anus and O. hemionus) to maximize ungulate biomass and numbers, when constrained by use of the major forage classes
and minimum viable populations (MVP) of those ungulate species that do not cross the boundary fence (bison and wapiti).
Maximum numbers of animals were achieved by a stocking combination dominated by deer and bison, whereas maximum
biomass was attained when bison and moose were abundant but deer were absent. Wapiti remained at MVP during all so-
lutions. Optimal solutions consistent with current ungulate densities were associated with 7 to 11% forage removal. This
is less than normally assumed for sustainable forage use, and may reflect the need to account for other biotic and abiotic
losses to forage in carrying capacity models for which ungulate densities can be constrained by availability of a preferred
forage class (e.g., grass) as well as forage quality. This research extends the conventional animal-unit concept to multi-
species systems and provides templates based on forage biomass allocation for resource managers facing similar problems
of joint stocking in different environments.

Elk Island National Park (EINP) is a small, enclosed and
carefully monitored park (194 km’) in western Canada that
provides an ideal opportunity to explore the concept of eco-
nomic carrying capacity. The park supports four species of
ungulates and is a relatively controlled environment due to
the lack of predators and complete enclosure of the park by a
2.1-m page wire fence. Because of the lack of predators and
the presence of the fence, resource managers are forced to
manage ungulate numbers relative to the available vegeta-
tion. The fence contains plains bison, wood bison and wapiti,
but allows movement of moose, white-tailed deer and mule
deer [43]. The ungulate guild within the park approaches the
biomass and productivity of multi-species grazing systems of
East Africa [44]. Because the density of ungulates is high
(11/km’), the range area is small, and the movements of un-
gulates are relatively fine-scale [45], carrying capacity calcu-
lations must be based on forage allocation.

Forage demand can be measured as the amount of forage
consumed per day and is often standardized as animal-units
[2]. One animal-unit is usually considered to be the body
mass equivalent of one domestic cow either with a calf less
than 6 months old (454 kg) or without a calf. One animal
unit is assumed to require 26 kg of forage (based on air-dried
weight) per day [2,22]. One animal-unit month is defined as
the sum of the daily requirements accumulated over one
month or approximately 780 kg of forage [32]. Perhaps be-
cause of its simplicity, the animal-unit concept has been
widely adopted by range managers concerned with grazing
livestock that are either similar in dietary preferences or
graze pastures with little opportunity for selection [2,33].
However, there are difficulties extending the animal-unit
concept to wild ungulates in heterogeneous environments
[22,34].

The objective of our research was to develop a protocol
and a template for an annual estimate of economic carrying
capacity for bison, moose, wapiti, and deer in the Main Park
(134 km’) of EINP (Fig. 1). Linear programming was used to
calculate optimal solutions for the maximum number and the
maximum biomass of ungulates given pre-set management
constraints (sustainable use of park vegetation and minimum
viable populations of bison and wapiti). An animal-unit-year
approach was used by matching annual forage supply (kg/ha
of grass, forbs, shrubs across four primary habitats) with the
corresponding ungulate demand estimated from seasonal
diets and intakes summed annually (kg forage per ungulate
per year). Feasible solutions require that resources last for
one full year, so solutions with seasonal shortfalls are ex-
cluded. This approach applies the principle of economic car-
rying capacity to evaluate an application for resource man-
agement and is not validated against forage utilization esti-
mates.

total annual forage used, an estimate of the annual forage
supply, an estimate of the total ungulate demand, and an ap-
propriate model structure, the optimal combination of bison,
moose, wapiti and deer in biomass, abundance or other
measure of value can be calculated. Finally, known densities
of ungulates in the park (December 2006) were compared to
the optimal stocking solutions reported at each level (total
annual forage used) tested. These solutions can be viewed as
initial estimates of economic carrying capacity for the ungu-

ity, it was assumed that a varied diet selection was required
to produce an optimal diet of energy-rich but sodium-poor
terrestrial plants, combined with energy-poor and sodium-
rich aquatic plants. Belovsky [51] determined optimal diet
was constrained by 1) energy, 2) sodium content, and 3) ru-
men size. Hobbs [52] later contested Belovsky’s approach
with specific criticisms of digestive constraints and ques-
tioned the high success of predictability. Although Be-
lovsky’s formulation has been criticized as inappropriate for
testing the optimal foraging theory [51,52], this is not an
indictment of linear programming as a method that has been
used successfully to examine forage allocation across a guild
of ungulates. Irby et al. [20] used linear programming to find
solutions for the optimal allocation of available forage to
multiple ungulates in Theodore Roosevelt National Park,
North Dakota.

EINP exists in a transitional zone between the prairie and
boreal forest with vegetation classified as dry mixedwood
boreal forest [21]. Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) is
the dominant tree species and commonly co-exists with bal-
sam poplar (Populus trichocarpa) or white birch (Betula
papyrifera), with additional small areas of white spruce
(Picea glauca) and black spruce (Picea mariana) in the
northern part of the park. Shrub understories consist of
beaked hazel (Corylus cornuta), dogwood (Cornus stolonif-
era), chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), willow (Salix spp.),
prickly rose (Rosa acicularis), raspberry (Rubus spp.) and
other shrubs. Common native grasses are Agropyron spp.,
Elymus innovatus and Oryzopsis asperifolia, with introduced
species being Trifolium spp., Bromus spp. and Poa spp.,
whereas wet meadows are dominated by Calamagrostis ca-
nadensis and hydric Carex spp. often with an overstory of
Salix spp. [58]. Vegetation composition is further described
by Bork et al. [59,60] and Hood et al. [57].

Forage supply was estimated using annual production of
three forage classes (grass, forbs, shrubs) across four habitat
types, and subsequently matched with the annual dietary
preferences and forage intake levels of each ungulate species
[20,48,49]. A forage “production by habitat” availability
matrix summarized forage biomass within each of the four
major habitat types of EINP (Table 1). A Geographic Infor-
mation System was used to calculate the area of each habitat
type based on the 1995 Alberta Vegetation Inventory cover-
age with refinements based on expert knowledge of the park
(N. Cool, Parks Canada, Environmental Resource Conserva-

in wetland coverage (Table 1). EINP does not have a com-

(kg/ha) for each of the four predominant habitats. Conse-

biomass for two habitat categories [61], an unpublished data

Although the linear programming framework is determi-

problems such as allocating a limited forage supply to a
guild of ungulate species. We used the Microsoft Excel©
linear programming “Add-In” (i.e., Microsoft Excel Solver

(i.e., bison, moose, wapiti, deer) could be optimized to
achieve 1) maximum number of individuals (animals/ha) and
2) maximum biomass (kg/ha) under the constraints of forage
availability and minimum viable populations for species
where this is a concern (i.e., bison and wapiti) (Fig. 1).

The two main assumptions in linear programming are (1)
the objective function (Z) is a linear function, f, of the deci-
sion variables, x,, x2, x3 and x4, and is of the form Z = f(x,
X2, X3, X4) and (2) all variables (e.g., densities) are non-
negative or more formally, all x1,x2,x3,x420.
